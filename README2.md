# Easy Shield

This project is made to fullfill Instant Pass Challange from BCC Front End Department.

You can see the live site [here](https://easy-shield.netlify.app).

## A Little Background

It all started when I got interested in badges, ya know, like the ones in the README of Git repos ![like this](https://img.shields.io/badge/like-this%20one-0F80C1). I wanted to make something similar.

So I was doing some googling and stumbled upon this website, [shields.io](https://shields.io). On there, I found that I could actually make my own badges for my projects!

The website is okay plus it's got the job done, but for a first-timer, it's not the most user-friendly. That's where the problem lies, and I kinda want to fix it by making more user-friendly interface.

Although the idea is there, but it's tough to actually do it since I keep getting interested in new frameworks and have other work that needs attention.

But now, I have an opportunity to take on an instant challenge from BCC and finally start this project. Plus, I have a chance for an instant pass. So hopefully this project won't stop here and can continue to grow to benefits the community.
